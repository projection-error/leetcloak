# What is it?
Chrome Extension for Leetcode to hide puzzle rating.

# Okay, but why?
Leetcoders solve coding problems to improve their skills. Part of problem-solving in the real world involves understanding the difficulty that a problem poses. On Leetcode, puzzles divulge their difficulty - this information gives the solver a heads-up on how much to think before coding. By cloaking the difficulty, LeetCloak prepares the coder for the feeling of real world problem-solving and also adds the challenge of estimating problem complexity. A strong intuition for problem complexity is instrumental to scoping a project and taking the optimal path.
